🍅 Pomidor Electron App – Documentation
📋 Project Overview

Pomidor Electron App is a lightweight desktop application built with Electron, Vue 3, and Vite.
It displays a pomidor (tomato) image as the main button, allowing the user to:

    Set a pause time (before the video starts).

    Set a video duration (how long the YouTube video will play).

    Save and load the YouTube video link automatically from localStorage.

    The application minimizes, waits, enters fullscreen mode to play a YouTube video, and then minimizes again — perfect for a "Pomodoro Timer" or productivity cycles.
